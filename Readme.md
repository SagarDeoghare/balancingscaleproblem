* Program is created for AX2 assignment test
* Program tested with System.in
* Program compiled with C++17 which also worked with backward compiler.
* Program created by considering incremental input as B1, B2 and...BN
* Map is used to store key value where key will be B1 is key and [10, B2] are values
* values are stored in vector of string cosidering vector[0] is leftNode and vector[1] is rightNode.
* Considering Time Map is easy option to insert and fetch data.
* Internally map uses binary search so to find key node is faster.
